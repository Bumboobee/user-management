# User Management Project

A complete üé≤ user management system made with PHP üêò

## Introduction

This project was created for educational purposes as part of the "T√≥picos Especiais em Inform√°tica" course at Faculdade Professor Antonio Seadra. It serves as a comprehensive user management system, designed to facilitate the management of users and products. Additionally, the project includes an admin area with permission controls for added security.

## Features

- User Registration and Management
  - Create, read, update, and delete user profiles.
- Product Management
  - Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.
- Admin Area with Permissions
  - Secure admin panel for authorized users, ensuring proper access control.

If you are using phpMyAdmin for your database management, you can modify the "Getting Started" section of your README to include steps for setting up the database using phpMyAdmin. Here's an updated version of that section:

## Getting Started

To get started with the User Management project and set up the database using phpMyAdmin, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Bumboobee/user-management.git
   ```

2. Set up a PHP development environment if you don't already have one. You can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or a local development server.

3. Import the project files into your web server directory.

4. Access phpMyAdmin through your web server's control panel. It is often accessible at `http://localhost/dashboard` or another URL configured during your local server setup.

5. Create a new database for this project, giving it a meaningful name like "crudproduto"

6. Open the project directory and find the SQL script file for connect to the database.

7. Import the SQL script into the "crudproduto" database you created in phpMyAdmin. This will set up the tables required for user and product management.

8. Configure the database connection in your project by editing the database configuration file to match the database settings in phpMyAdmin.

9. Access the project in your web browser and start managing users and products.

By following these steps, you will have your User Management project connected to a database created and managed through phpMyAdmin.

## Usage

- Navigate to the user management dashboard.
- Use the admin area to control user access and permissions.
- Add, edit, or remove user profiles as needed.
- Perform CRUD operations for products.
